""" Number Guessing game

Task:
Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses

The minimum number of guesses depends upon range.
